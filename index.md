## Intro

<img class="profile-picture" src="Yale_logo.jpg">

Hi! 

We are organizing a reading group on Network Econometrics. This is a relatively novel field within econometrics and we are eager to learn more about it. Our goal is to understand some of the recent literature and obtain an understanding of where this literature is going. In the pursuit of this goal we have created a [reading list](https://ikleni.github.io/researcher/Networks%20RG_Winter%202021.pdf), which very broadly covers many topics in Network Econometrics. We will not manage to cover all of those papers, but hope to go over many of them.

## Organisational Details

We plan to meet bi-weekly on Mondays at 15:00 New York in Zoom. Meetings links will be provided via Yale Econometrics mailing list. Each meeting will be a **50min** presentation of a paper from the reading list; **10 min** after the presentation will be devoted for discussion. Sometimes there will be guest lectures during which professors involved in an active research in Network Econometrics will discuss their work.

## Publications

1. F.Bar, J.Doe: Effects of having a placeholder of a name
2. S.Holmes, J.Watson: Consequences of living with a sociopath in London
