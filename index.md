## Intro

<img class="profile-picture" src="Yale_logo.jpg">

Hi! 

We are organizing a reading group on Network Econometrics at Yale. This is a relatively novel field within econometrics and we are eager to learn more about it. Our goal is to understand some of the recent literature and obtain an understanding of where this literature is going.
<br/>  <br/>

To do so we have created a [reading list](https://ikleni.github.io/researcher/Networks%20RG_Winter%202021.pdf), which very broadly covers many topics in Network Econometrics. We will not manage to cover all of those papers, but hope to go over many of them.

<br/>  <br/>

## Organizational Details
<br/>  <br/>

We plan to meet bi-weekly on Mondays at **15:00 New York** on **Zoom**. Meetings links will be provided via **Yale Econometrics mailing list**. 

Each meeting will be a ~50min presentation of a paper from the reading list; ~10-20 min after the presentation will be devoted for discussion. Sometimes there will be guest lectures during which professors involved in an active research in Network Econometrics will discuss their work.
